**Crypto QIS**
This repository is designed to experiment with various quantitative investment strategies in cryptocurrency, including staking indices and a replica of the Bitwise Trendwise Index focused on Bitcoin.

Bitwise Asset Managementâ€™s Trendwise strategies aim to deliver improved risk-adjusted returns on cryptocurrency futures compared to traditional buy-and-hold approaches. The approach dynamically adjusts between full exposure to cryptocurrency futures and a full allocation to short-term U.S. Treasuries.
